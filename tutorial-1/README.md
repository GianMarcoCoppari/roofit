# TUTORIAL 1

## EXERCISE 1 - FIT OF A CRYSTAL BALL PDF

### Part 1
Edit the macro *roofit_empty.cpp* and, following the comments inside, create a Crystal Ball PDF with 
* $$\mu = 0$$,
* $$\sigma = 1$$,
* $$\alpha = 1.5$$,
* $$n = 1.5$$.

Change $$\sigma$$ to $$0.3$$ and visualize the PDF.


### Part 2

Generate an unbinned dataset of $$10000$$ events. Make a Fit with Maximum Likelihood and visualize the results.
_Tips_:
* Use information from the slides shown during the lecture or from RooFit Manual at par 2
* Refer to the tutorial _rf101_basics.cxx_
* Find the definition of _RooCBshape_ in the _ROOT Class reference_

Submit the macro as _ex_2020_1.cpp_ and the image of the canvas in png format.
